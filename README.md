Replication tables for Econ 70330

This project replicates three tables, each from a different paper. I think the organization of the directory is straightforward, but just to be explicit:
- To replicate “Information Rigidity and the Expectations Formation Process: A Simple Framework and New Facts” American Economic Review Coibion and Gorodnichenko (2015) – Table 1, run Coibion-Gorodnichenko/Coibion-Gorodnichenko-main.qmd
- To replicate “Overreaction in Macroeconomic Expectations” American Economic Review Bordalo, Gennaioli, Ma, and Shleifer (2020) - Table 3, run Bordalo-et-al/Bordalo-et-al-main.qmd
- To replicate “Subjective Intertemporal Substitution” Journal of Monetary Economics Crump, Eusepi, Tambalotti, and Topa (2022) – Table 3, run Crump-et-al/Crump-et-al-main.qmd

As always with R, the usual caveat applies: make sure you have installed all the necessary packages (i.e. all those inside a library() function call)
